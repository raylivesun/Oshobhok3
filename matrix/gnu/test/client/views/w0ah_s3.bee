/*
As described by De Bock, Van Dooren, and Verschaffel (Chap. 3), the Belgian
approach to mathematics education was undoubtedly inspired by the Dutch RME
model, which is, for example, reflected by the fact that the general objectives for pri-
mary school mathematics in Belgium are almost copies of those that were formulated
by Treffers and colleagues in the late 1980s. Nevertheless, Belgian mathematics edu-
cation is not considered to be RME. References to ‘realistic’ are purposely avoided
and instead expressions are used such as ‘meaningful situations’, which indicates
that other choices have been made in mathematics education. An illustration of this
is that in Belgium, in contrast with the Netherlands, attention is paid first to standard
arithmetical procedures, and more flexible procedures are only taught afterwards.*/
